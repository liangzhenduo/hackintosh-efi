Innie
=====

A kernel extension for making all PCIe drives appear internal in macOS.
  
#### Alternative

An alternative to Innie is to add the `built-in` device property for each drive. This can be accomplished with [OpenCore](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg).

#### Dependency

Innie uses [MacKernelSDK](https://github.com/acidanthera/MacKernelSDK).
